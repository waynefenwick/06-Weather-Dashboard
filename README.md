## Description

Travel may be a big part of your life. One of the first things we always look at when traveling, is what the weather is doing and will be doing. The Weather Dashboard app is a great tool to keep handy on your PC, laptop or smartphone. You cna very quickly checkout relevant weather information that you are needing to know. You have the opportunity to save your favorite cities to a list. This enables you to quickly retrieve weather information for a specific city to which you may be traveling. You also have the option to enter another city of choice and quickly retrieve weather data. The app provides you with current conditions that are updated every 3 hours. It also provides you with an 8-day forecast of approaching weather for the city of choice. Take time to review this app. You will be glad you did...and you will find it extremely useful!
